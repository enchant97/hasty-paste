# Install
This section will demonstrate how Hasty Paste can be installed and configured.

## Important Notes
Please read these notes before continuing.

- Running on a filesystem that is case-insensitive is **not** supported
- Running multiple instances is supported, you could even use rsync to sync between multiple file systems.
- The paste root directory must have read/write permissions for the user running the app
- Access to add and read pastes is public, use a reverse proxy to add authentication
- A HTTPS connection at endpoint is required for the "Copy Share Link" button
- Use HTTPS otherwise paste links are exposed to man-in-the-middle attacks

## Configuration
All configs shown here should be given as environment variables.

## With Docker (Recommended)
This will assume you have both Docker and Docker Compose installed.

1. Create directory for app
2. Create file called `docker-compose.yml` inside folder
3. Copy example compose file shown below
4. Run `docker-compose up -d` inside folder
5. Hasty Paste is now running

```yml
version: "3"

services:
  paste-bin:
    container_name: paste-bin
    image: ghcr.io/enchant97/hasty-paste:1
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - data:/app/data
    ports:
      - 8000:8000
    environment:
      - "UI_DEFAULT__USE_LONG_ID=False"

volumes:
  data:
```

## Without Docker
This will assume the supported Python version is installed and accessible.

1. Clone the repository
2. Create virtual Python environment
3. Install requirements
4. Run the app

```
git clone https://github.com/enchant97/hasty-paste

cd paste-bin

python -m venv .venv

source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

hypercorn 'paste_bin.main:create_app()' --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 --workers 1
```

If you wish to configure Hypercorn the documentation can be found [here](https://pgjones.gitlab.io/hypercorn/), you could for example configure https or different bind methods.
